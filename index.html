        <p>With the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, the U.S.-Mexico border has received renewed attention. Trump, who made the border one of his main talking points during his campaign, has said not only will he build a wall, but he will convince Mexico to pay for it.</p><p></p><p>Whether or not a wall is necessary or effective is highly contested. Proponents of a wall cite the prevalence of crime along the border as one reason to build a wall. Trump, in particular, received much criticism for remarks he made about Mexicans which many viewed as racist and uninformed. Regardless of whether Trump's remarks were too broad or overarching, tactless or imprudent, the issue of crime along the border and the effects of a wall deserve further investigation.</p>

        <p>El Paso, Texas is regarded as one of the safest large cities in America. This is in stark contrast to its sister city across the U.S.-Mexico border, Ciudad Juarez, which as recently as 2010 held the title of the most violent city in the world. Operation Hold the Line took place in El Paso, Texas and was the first operation to focus on preventing illegal immigrants from entering the United States, rather than apprehending them once they arrived. The El Paso Border Patrol created a physical barrier along the border using its agents and vehicles. The operation was deemed successful in preventing illegal immigrants from crossing the border in the area, though many still crossed in the rugged terrain outside of the city. In the fiscal year 1993-1994, apprehensions in the El Paso sector dropped 72 percent. There was also a drop in the violent crime rate in the city of El Paso, which has seen a downward trend in violent crime since the operation was initiated in 1993. Violent crime rates are based on the number of crimes per 100,000 population.</p>

        <p>In 1994, Operation Gatekeeper was initiated in the San Diego Sector. Like Operation Hold the Line, Gatekeeper focused on preventing illegal alien entry into the U.S. instead of on apprehension.  </p><p></p><p>In 1990, an initiative to build physical barriers began in San Diego, with the city installing a 10-foot welded steel fence along an estimated 14 miles of border. The fence replaced a previously existing chain link fence in the region and closed gaps that had existed in the old fence. It was completed in 1993. While there was a spike in violent crime in the early 1990s, the violent crime rate has been steadily declining since it reached its peak in 1992.</p>

        <p>A similar decline can be seen in Brownsville, after Operation Rio Grande was initiated in 1997. Operation Rio Grande did not include the building of a wall, but instead the utilization of other resources. Sixty-nine Border Patrol agents were detailed to the Rio Grande Valley Sector (then called the McAllen Sector) as well as detention and deportation officers, special agents and overtime resources. </p><p></p><p>Infrared scopes for night surveillance, 428 movement sensors and 74 new Border Patrol vehicles  were also deployed. </p>

        <p>While securing the border does seem to have an effect on the violent crime rates of U.S. cities along the border, this does not tell the entire story of the border region. It is true that there is much violent crime along the border related to the drug trade, but that is not the paradigm of the Mexican immigrant.  Many opponents of a wall look at the millions of immigrants who come to America simply looking for a better life as reason not to build a barrier. </p><p></p><p>Because many of the easiest crossing points have been secured over the past two decades, migrants have been forced to cross in less inhabitable areas. They go around the fences and blockades into the deserts and other rugged terrain, where many of them lose their lives. </p><p></p><p>Migrant deaths in the Rio Grande Valley sector more than doubled upon completion of what is called Pedestrian Fence 255 in the area in 2010. Deaths have slightly declined since the initial spike in the early 2010s, but as of 2015 the Rio Grande sector still had more immigrant deaths than any other sector.</p>

        <p>Construction and placement of physical barriers does seem to at least be strongly correlated with a decrease in violent crime rates in San Diego and El Paso. However, there also seems to have been a decrease in violent crime rates in Brownsville after the initiation of Operation Rio Grande, which relied more heavily on increased border patrol than physical barriers. So the question remains of whether the decrease in violent crime rates should be attributed to physical barriers, increased border patrol or some third factor.</p><p></p><p>There is also the question of migrant deaths. Perhaps if there was a wall across the entire border, migrant deaths would actually decrease, because the potential immigrants would not be able to cross at all, and therefore would never be subjected to the harsh environmental conditions leading to death. However, this ignores the practical question of how to construct physical barriers in areas with canyons, valleys and rivers. </p><p></p><p>Migrant deaths are less likely the more border patrol agents there are, because the agents can find the migrants and rescue them. It may be that the best solution to the problem of violent crime in border towns and migrant deaths is to increase the number of border patrol agents instead of building a wall.</p><p></p><p>The question of the best policy regarding the Southwest Border is an intriguing one, and one that will likely be in the news often during Trump's presidency.</p>
